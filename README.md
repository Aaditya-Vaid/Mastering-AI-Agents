# ü§ñ Mastering-AI-Agents

Hey guys, I am starting a new journey of Mastering AI Agents. I will be mainly following a GitHub repo by [Dave Ebbelaar](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook).

Also, I will be using 2 LLM providers other than OpenAI, those will be **Groq** and **Gemini**. And, 1 framework **LangChain**. In the future, I might use **CrewAI** when I will be dealing with Multi-Agent Applications.
